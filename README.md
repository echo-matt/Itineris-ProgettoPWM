# Itineris-ProgettoPWM
Progetto PWM

This is a university project developed by Matteo Paternò & Eugenio Carramusa for the course "Mobile & Web development" of the Informatic Engineering course at Università degli Studi di Palermo

It consist of a travel app, which allows users to search hotels, restaurants and points of interest in various cities

The project is far from done, there are a lot of things i would have liked to develop but time was strict as we developed this app while studying for other subjects.
It was ours first approach at Kotlin and android studio in general, but we have put a lot of effort in it and we learned a lot of stuff.

It contains usage of retrofit to handle RESTful APIs, together with handling JSON objects/array which our django server (provided by our professor) used as response.
