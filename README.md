# Itineris-ProgettoPWM
Progetto PWM

This is a university project developed by Matteo Paternò & Eugenio Carramusa for the course "Mobile & Web development" of the Informatic Engineering course at Università degli Studi di Palermo

The project is far from done, it was ours first approach at Kotlin and android studio in general, but we put a lot of effort in it and we learned a lot of stuff

It contains usage of retrofit to handle RESTful APIs, together with handling JSON objects/array which our django server (provided by our professor) used as response.
